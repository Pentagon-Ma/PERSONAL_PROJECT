# Introductory mental model study of concurrent programming (closed)

This is the source code I finalized to run the experiment concerning the mental models when people try to read or understand the concurrent programs. The study is built and published online on [pavlovia.org](http://pavlovia.org) (currently closed already).

This code project was built by `PsychoPy` first, then uploaded to [pavlovia.org](http://pavlovia.org) to make it online. After uploading I slightly modified the javascript code `ver_6.js` to eliminate all the bugs. The `ver_6-legacy-browsers.js` was automatically generated when I uploaded the project, so nobody had actually used it.

The code I used to present to people was adapted from *Venkatesh Prasad Ranganath* and *John Hatcliffâ€™s* work *Slicing Concurrent Java Programs using Indus and Kaveri*. It is a peer-reviewed code, so it is guaranteed to be glitch-less. The reason I adapted this short code was that we don't expect people to remember a huge program because I didn't want to show the code to the participants when they answer the questions.

Due to confidentiality issues, I didn't upload the `data` folder coming along with this study, since I have promised in the informed consent form that I only use the participants' email address for the gift card reward, but nothing else.
